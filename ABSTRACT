       ABSTRACT
       
    
Crossy road game Simulation Computer Graphics Mini Project is to illustrate the concepts and usage of pre- built functions in OpenGL.
The Objective of Crossy Road game is to move across each lane to reach the other side of the road by avoiding the moving obstacles. 
The player plays as a character where he accomplishes the game’s objective. With the use of arrow keys,
the character moves in the appropriate direction such as Forward, Left and Right to reach the opposite side of the Road, which is the main goal of the game.
The game consists of levels, where the speed of obstacles in a set path, such as cars increases as the level progresses.
The player must time movements correctly in order to pass these obstacles without touching the obstacle.
We have used input device keyboard to interact with the program.

The objective of Crossy Road is to cross lanes or series of roads and avoid obstacles as far as possible without dying. The player plays as a chosen character and must tap up arrow key to go forward to move the character horizontally. The game consists of an endless series of obstacles(cars) in a set path. The player must time movements correctly in order to pass these obstacles without dying. If the player takes too much time crossing an obstacle, or goes idle, the obstacle would hit the player, resulting in the game's end.




INSTRUCTIONS:
The legend for user interaction is as follows:


“Q/q”	           To quit.

“L/l”	           To go to next level.

“up arrow”	     To move forward.

“down arrow”	   To move backward.

“right arrow”	   To move right

“left arrow”	    To move left
